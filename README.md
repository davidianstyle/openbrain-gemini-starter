# OpenBrain (Gemini CLI Edition)

**A personal AI Chief of Staff in an Obsidian vault, managed by Gemini CLI.**

OpenBrain is a portable template for a [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/) (LYT) knowledge base that doubles as an operating layer for [Gemini CLI](https://geminicli.com/). Clone it, run one setup script, and you get:

- A fully scaffolded Obsidian vault (Inbox, Spaces, Atlas, Sources, Templates)
- 21 pre-built Chief of Staff [skills](#skills) with matching [slash commands](#commands)
- Multi-account MCP wiring for Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Meet, Google Drive/Docs/Sheets, Slack, Asana, and Fathom — any number of accounts per service
- Automatic git sync via Gemini CLI SessionStart/SessionEnd hooks
- A people data model with cadence tracking, interaction logging, and alias resolution

Built for people who want Gemini to act on their calendar, email, tasks, and notes the way a human chief of staff would — proactively, with context, and without constant re-briefing.

> This is the **Gemini CLI** edition of [OpenBrain](https://github.com/davidianstyle/openbrain-template). The original Claude Code edition lives at [openbrain-template](https://github.com/davidianstyle/openbrain-template).

## Prerequisites

- **macOS** (Linux should work; untested)
- **git** — usually `xcode-select --install`
- **Python 3.10+** — `brew install python` (system python also works)
- **Node.js 20+** — `brew install node` (or asdf / nvm)
- **Gemini CLI** — `npm install -g @google/gemini-cli` ([docs](https://geminicli.com/docs/))
- **Obsidian** — [download](https://obsidian.md)
- Optional: **GitHub CLI** (`brew install gh`) if you want automated remote setup

---

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidianstyle/openbrain-gemini-starter.git ~/OpenBrain
cd ~/OpenBrain
./bootstrap/setup.sh
```

The wizard will:

1. Ask for your name and writing-voice blurb
2. Customize `GEMINI.md` with your details
3. Create `~/.config/openbrain/` and copy launcher scripts
4. Walk you through Google Cloud OAuth setup (one-time, 5 minutes)
5. Loop through each service and ask which accounts to add:
   - "Add a Google account?" → y → paste email → browser OAuth → done
   - "Add another?" → repeat for as many as you want
   - Same for Slack workspaces, Asana, Fathom
6. Register every MCP server in `~/.gemini/settings.json`
7. Wire SessionStart + SessionEnd git-sync hooks
8. Validate the install

Start Gemini CLI in the vault directory and run `/daily-brief` as your first skill.

---

## Adding accounts later

The wizard is not a one-shot. You can add services any time:

```bash
./bootstrap/lib/add-google-account.sh jane@newdomain.com
./bootstrap/lib/add-slack-workspace.sh newteam           # → newteam.slack.com
./bootstrap/lib/add-asana.sh personal                    # or work
./bootstrap/lib/add-fathom.sh
./bootstrap/lib/register-mcps.sh                         # re-sync ~/.gemini/settings.json
```

Each script is idempotent — safe to re-run.

### Skills

Gemini CLI auto-discovers skills in `.gemini/skills/` and activates them when a task matches. Each skill is a SKILL.md file with instructions Gemini follows.

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `daily-brief` | Morning briefing across all your calendars, mail, Slack, tasks |
| `daily-review` | End-of-day reconciliation — check off tasks, push Asana updates |
| `process-inbox` | Triage `+ Inbox/` + Gmail + Slack; auto-push tagged tasks to Asana |
| `meeting-prep` | Assemble a briefing for a meeting or 1:1 |
| `capture-meeting` | Turn notes/transcript into an interaction note, update people |
| `capture-youtube` | Literature note from a YouTube video |
| `log-person` | Create a person note, seeded from Gmail/Slack |
| `log-note` | Quick-capture a thought as an atomic note |
| `log-interaction` | Manual touchpoint log |
| `log-idea` | Record an idea |
| `log-decision` | Record a decision with context and alternatives |
| `log-goal` | Create a goal with definition of done |
| `log-place` | Create a place note |
| `log-organization` | Create an organization note |
| `log-quote` | Save a quote |
| `follow-up-draft` | Draft a reply email/Slack message (never sends) |
| `what-am-i-missing` | Surface overdue tasks, cadence misses, unanswered mail |
| `people-audit` | Cadence health report + regenerate People MOC |
| `people-sync` | Discovery pass across Gmail/Calendar/Slack to find unknown people |
| `weekly-review` | Monday synthesis |
| `asana` | Quick view of upcoming Asana tasks with interactive check-off |

### Commands

Custom commands in `.gemini/commands/` provide explicit slash-command access to each skill:

```
/daily-brief          # run the daily briefing
/daily-brief 2026-04-20  # briefing for a specific date
/log-note My thought about X
/capture-meeting <paste notes>
/what-am-i-missing
```

### Supported MCP servers

One stdio MCP server per (service x account) pair, so routing is explicit:

- **Google** (`google-mcp`) — Gmail, Calendar, Meet, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides — one consolidated server per Google account
- **Slack** (`slack-mcp`) — one per workspace
- **Asana** (`asana-mcp`) — personal + work
- **Fathom** (`fathom-mcp`) — single instance

All launched via `~/.config/openbrain/lib/*-mcp.sh` wrappers that source `~/.config/openbrain/.env`.

## How it differs from the Claude Code edition

| Feature | Claude Code edition | Gemini CLI edition |
|---|---|---|
| Context file | `CLAUDE.md` | `GEMINI.md` |
| Config directory | `.claude/` | `.gemini/` |
| MCP registration | `~/.claude.json` | `~/.gemini/settings.json` |
| Hook events | `Stop` / `SessionStart` | `SessionEnd` / `SessionStart` |
| Slash commands | Built into skills (Claude auto-invokes) | `.gemini/commands/*.toml` wrappers |
| Skills format | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | `.gemini/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (same format!) |
| MCP tool prefix | `mcp__server__tool` | `mcp_server_tool` |

The vault structure, templates, people model, and skill procedures are identical. You can run both editions side-by-side on the same vault if you have both CLIs installed — just add both `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md`, and both `.claude/` and `.gemini/` directories.

## Design principles

- **Capture first, organize later.** Everything starts in `+ Inbox/`.
- **Atomic notes.** One idea per note. If it wants to split, split it.
- **Links over folders.** Structure comes from `[[wikilinks]]` and MOCs.
- **Never delete, always archive.** Move to `+ Archive/`, never `rm`.
- **Git is the sync layer.** No Obsidian Sync. The SessionEnd hook auto-commits and pushes.
- **Skills are markdown procedures.** Gemini reads them and performs the steps.
- **People are first-class entities.** Every person gets a note. Interactions link back. Cadence is tracked.
- **Multi-account by default.** Every external service is wired per-account with routing tags.

## Troubleshooting

See [`bootstrap/README.md`](bootstrap/README.md) for:
- Re-running parts of the wizard
- Google OAuth gotchas (admin-managed Workspace accounts, "unverified app" screens)
- Slack workspace admin approval
- Rotating tokens
- Removing an account
