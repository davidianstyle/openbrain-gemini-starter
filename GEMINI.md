# GEMINI.md — OpenBrain Vault Operating Manual

This vault is **{{USER_NAME}}'s OpenBrain**: a personal LYT (Linking Your Thinking) knowledge base where Gemini CLI is a first-class collaborator. Read this file at the start of every session in this vault.

> This file was generated from the [openbrain-gemini-starter](https://github.com/davidianstyle/openbrain-gemini-starter) template. Re-run `bootstrap/setup.sh` to regenerate account tables after adding/removing services, or run `bootstrap/lib/add-*.sh` for incremental changes.

## 1. Identity and structure

- **Primary collaborator:** {{USER_NAME}}.
- **Structure:** LYT / Maps of Content. Organization emerges from `[[wikilinks]]` and MOCs, not from deep folders.
- **Top-level folders** (the `+` prefix sorts them to the top of Obsidian's file explorer):
  - `+ Inbox/` — capture first, unprocessed notes land here
  - `+ Spaces/` — MOCs (Maps of Content) — curated link hubs per topic
  - `+ Atlas/` — atomic notes (the actual knowledge); `+ Atlas/Daily/` for daily notes, `+ Atlas/Weekly Reviews/` for weekly reviews
  - `+ Sources/` — literature and reference notes
  - `+ Extras/Templates/` — note templates (wired into Obsidian core Templates plugin)
  - `+ Extras/Attachments/` — legacy media folder (unused; Local Images Plus saves to `.resources/${notename}/` next to each note)
  - `+ Archive/` — cold storage
- **Home.md** is the front door; its "Top MOCs" section lists your Maps of Content.

## 2. Frontmatter schema (per template)

All notes must have frontmatter. Required fields by template:

- **Daily** — `title`, `date`, `tags: [daily]`
- **Literature** — `title`, `source`, `author`, `url`, `accessed`, `tags: [literature]`
- **MOC** — `title`, `tags: [moc]`, `created`
- **Atomic** — `title`, `created`, `tags`
- **Project** — `title`, `status`, `workspace` (personal|work), `asana_project_gid`, `created`, `tags: [project, moc]`
- **Task** — `title`, `asana_gid`, `asana_workspace`, `status`, `tags: [task]`
- **Person** — `title`, `relationship`, `cadence`, `created`, `tags: [person]` (plus optional `emails`, `slack`, `phones`, `aliases`, `last_contact`)
- **Interaction** — `title`, `date`, `channel`, `people`, `tags: [interaction]` (plus optional `projects`, `source`)
- **Idea** — `title`, `created`, `tags: [idea]`
- **Decision** — `title`, `date`, `status` (active|superseded|reversed), `tags: [decision]`
- **Goal** — `title`, `status` (active|paused|achieved|abandoned), `target_date`, `created`, `tags: [goal]`
- **Place** — `title`, `type` (church|office|restaurant|venue|home|other), `created`, `tags: [place]` (plus optional `address`)
- **Organization** — `title`, `type` (company|church|nonprofit|group|other), `created`, `tags: [organization]` (plus optional `url`)
- **Quote** — `title`, `author`, `source`, `created`, `tags: [quote]`

Missing-field notes are flagged (warn-only) by the pre-commit hook.

## 3. Link and tag conventions

- **Always prefer `[[wikilinks]]`** over markdown links for inter-vault references. Unlinked mentions of an existing note title should be upgraded to a link on next touch.
- **Tag taxonomy** (flat + hierarchical):
  - Content type: `#daily`, `#moc`, `#literature`, `#task`, `#project`, `#idea`, `#decision`, `#goal`, `#place`, `#organization`, `#quote`
  - Asana routing: `#asana/personal`, `#asana/work`
  - Project scoping: `#project/<slug>`
  - State: `#needs-review`, `#stub`
- No free-form tagging — if you want a new tag, propose it first.

## 4. Inbox triage workflow

When asked to triage `+ Inbox/`, or during scheduled nightly triage:

1. Read each note in `+ Inbox/`.
2. Classify: **atomic** (single idea → `+ Atlas/`), **literature** (external source → `+ Sources/`), **task** (actionable → see §5), **project kickoff** (multi-step → new MOC in `+ Spaces/`), or **ephemeral** (discard / archive).
3. Propose destination + any `[[links]]` to existing notes or MOCs.
4. **For scheduled/nightly runs:** act without confirmation when the classification is unambiguous AND notes with `#asana/*` tags get auto-pushed (see §5). Leave ambiguous items in `+ Inbox/` prepended with a `#needs-review` marker.
5. **For interactive runs:** propose and wait for approval before moving files.
6. When moving a note, update any existing backlinks.

## 5. Asana routing rules

Asana MCP servers are registered per workspace. The bootstrap supports any combination of `personal` and `work` (or skip entirely).

_No Asana workspaces configured yet. Run `./bootstrap/lib/add-asana.sh personal|work` to add one._

### Sync semantics

- Frontmatter fields `asana_gid` and `asana_workspace` are the source of truth for sync.
- **If `asana_gid` is set:** update the existing task. Never create a duplicate.
- **If `asana_gid` is empty:** create a new task and write the returned gid + workspace back into frontmatter.
- **Auto-push during nightly triage** is opt-in: if you've set that preference, notes tagged `#asana/*` push without confirmation in scheduled runs.
- Still confirm before creating Asana tasks for notes without clear tags, or for bulk operations (>5 tasks at once).

## 6. Writing assistant guidance

This section is the source of truth for how drafted communications should sound. The drafter skills (`/draft-follow-up`, `/daily-brief`, `/process-inbox`) read this section and apply it. To (re)derive these bullets from your real sent messages, run `/learn-writing-style`.

- **Drafting voice (general):** match {{USER_NAME}}'s voice — {{USER_VOICE}}. Default until you run `/learn-writing-style`: direct and terse, no filler, no preamble; lead with the ask or the answer.
- **Em-dashes:** use sparingly in drafted communications. LLM-generated messages tend to overuse them. `/learn-writing-style` will detect whether your sent messages avoid em-dashes entirely and, if so, replace this with a hard "never use" rule.
- **Email style:** complete sentences with proper capitalization. Sign off with your preferred closer (e.g. `Best, <your-first-name>`). Each paragraph is a single unbroken line; only use blank lines (`\n\n`) between paragraphs. Gmail preserves hard line breaks within a paragraph and renders them as a narrow column instead of reflowing, so never insert `\n` mid-paragraph.
- **Slack style — small audiences (DMs, group DMs, thread replies):** match the thread's existing tone, leaning casual. Skip greetings and sign-offs; just the substance. Use markdown (`*bold*`, backtick code, bullets) where it adds clarity.
- **Slack style — large audiences (broadcast channels, announcements):** more formal register. Bullets and bold for structure on longer posts. Lead with a one-line summary. Still no greetings/sign-offs.
- **Expanding stubs:** if a note is a one-liner or has `#stub`, offer to expand it using linked context and related notes.
- **Surfacing related notes:** search across `+ Atlas/` and `+ Spaces/` to find genuinely relevant prior thinking before writing anything new.
- **Never invent facts** or create fake citations. If you need a source, say so.

_Default profile shipped with the starter. Run `/learn-writing-style` to derive these bullets from your real sent mail and Slack messages._

## 7. Research mode

- Fetch web content → create a literature note in `+ Sources/` using the Literature template.
- Always include `url`, `author`, `accessed` date in frontmatter.
- Quote sparingly; summarize in your own words.
- Link from the literature note back to any Atlas notes or MOCs it relates to.

## 8. Obsidian interaction model

### Attachments

- **Local Images Plus** (recommended community plugin) auto-downloads and localizes external image URLs. Configure it with `realTimeUpdate: true` (5 s poll) and `processCreated: true` so it handles notes Gemini creates. Be aware that image URLs Gemini writes may be rewritten to local paths seconds later; do not treat the rewrite as an error or conflict.
- Attachments land in `.resources/${notename}/` next to the note (recommended plugin config).
- **Images/media:** save or reference in-line; the plugin handles localization.
- **External docs** (Google Docs, Sheets, PDFs hosted elsewhere): link by URL, don't download.
- **Meeting artifacts:** if a transcript references a shared screen or document, note it as `> [Shared: <description>]` in the interaction note body.

### Concurrent editing

Obsidian hot-reloads files when they change on disk. This is fine for content, but **frontmatter edits can race** — if you have a note open in Obsidian's Properties panel with unsaved changes, Gemini's write may be overwritten when Obsidian saves. Convention:
- Do not edit a note's Properties panel in Obsidian while a skill that touches that note is running.
- For automated / scheduled runs this is a non-issue (you won't be editing simultaneously).
- Git is the sole sync mechanism (Obsidian Sync is disabled). The user handles git commits and pushes manually or via their own automation.

### Template evolution

When a template in `+ Extras/Templates/` gains or removes a required frontmatter field, existing notes won't match. The pre-commit hook lints for missing fields (warn-only), but hundreds of stale daily notes triggering warnings is noise, not signal. Convention:
- **Every template schema change must include a migration plan** — either a one-off Gemini CLI task to backfill/remove the field across existing notes, or an explicit decision to grandfather old notes.
- Document the change in the commit message so future sessions can reconstruct history.

## 9. What you must NOT do

- **Never silently delete notes.** Move to `+ Archive/` instead, and only on explicit request.
- **Never move notes out of `+ Archive/`** without explicit request.
- **Never push to Asana without a `#asana/*` tag.**
- **Never `git commit` or `git push` unless the user explicitly asks.** Git operations are the user's responsibility.
- **Never modify `~/.config/openbrain/.env`** or echo its contents.
- **Never commit real secrets** to `.openbrain/env.example`. It is the tracked template; the real `.env` lives at `~/.config/openbrain/.env` (mode 600) and is out of repo.

## 10. Maintenance automation

- **Pre-commit hook** (`.openbrain/pre-commit.sh`) — frontmatter + broken-link linter, warn-only. Linked by setup.sh into `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.
- **Auto git sync hooks** (opt-in, configured during setup):
  - **SessionStart hook** (`.openbrain/on-start.sh`) — `git pull --rebase` (fail-soft; never blocks).
  - **SessionEnd hook** (`.openbrain/on-stop.sh`) — regenerates Home.md MOC index, then smart-commits all changes and pushes (skip-if-clean, pull-rebase first, conflict → inbox note).
  - These hooks are **not enabled by default**. Enable them during `./bootstrap/setup.sh` or by adding the hooks section to `.gemini/settings.json` manually.

### Vault scaling and archive policy

Daily notes, interactions, and people candidates grow linearly. To keep the vault efficient for both Gemini (grep/read) and Obsidian (graph, search):

- **Daily notes older than 6 months:** archive to `+ Archive/Daily/` during `/weekly-review`. The weekly review summary in `+ Atlas/Weekly Reviews/` is the long-term record; individual dailies are ephemeral once reviewed.
- **Interaction notes:** keep indefinitely in `+ Atlas/Interactions/` — they are the audit trail for the people model.
- **People candidates:** stubs in `+ Inbox/people-candidates/` older than 90 days without promotion should be archived to `+ Archive/People candidates/` during `/people-audit`.
- **Sources:** keep indefinitely — they are reference material.
- Archiving means `git mv` to the `+ Archive/` subtree. Backlinks from non-archived notes should be updated to point to the new path (Obsidian's auto-update handles this if the move happens in Obsidian; for Gemini moves, update manually).

## 11. Multi-account MCP routing

Local stdio MCP servers, each scoped to a single account + service, launched via wrapper scripts in `~/.config/openbrain/` that source `.env`. All secrets live in `~/.config/openbrain/.env`; the tracked template is `.openbrain/env.example`.

MCP servers are configured in `.gemini/settings.json` under the `mcpServers` key (and merged into `~/.gemini/settings.json` by the bootstrap). Each server exposes tools prefixed by service and namespaced as `mcp_<serverName>_<toolName>`.

Google services (Gmail, Calendar, Meet, Drive/Docs/Sheets, and Slides) are served by a single consolidated MCP server per account (`google-mcp`), launched via `google-mcp.sh <slug>`. Each server exposes tools prefixed by service: `gmail_*`, `calendar_*`, `meet_*`, `drive_*`, `docs_*`, `sheets_*`, `slides_*`.

### Configured accounts

_No Google accounts configured yet. Run `./bootstrap/lib/add-google-account.sh <email>` to add one._

_No Slack workspaces configured yet. Run `./bootstrap/lib/add-slack-workspace.sh <subdomain>` to add one._

_Fathom not configured. Run `./bootstrap/lib/add-fathom.sh` to add it._

### Slug convention

- **CLI slug:** `<local>-<domain-with-dashes>` for email accounts (e.g. `jane@acme.com` → `jane-acme-com`), `<subdomain>-slack-com` for Slack workspaces. Dashes only, no dots (Obsidian tag constraint).
- **MCP server key:** same slug with `-` → `_` (JSON key convention). Avoid underscores in server aliases to prevent tool name collisions.
- **Env var name:** uppercased slug with `-` → `_`.

### Routing tags

- `#google/<slug>` — one per Google account (covers Gmail, Calendar, Meet, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides)
- `#slack/<slug>` — one per Slack workspace
- `#asana/personal`, `#asana/work` — Asana workspace routing
- `#workspace/personal` vs `#workspace/work` — umbrella grouping for cross-service filtering

### Adding an account after initial setup

Re-run the incremental add script from the vault root:

```bash
./bootstrap/lib/add-google-account.sh <email>      # adds one Google account (Gmail+Cal+Meet+Drive)
./bootstrap/lib/add-slack-workspace.sh <subdomain> # adds one Slack workspace
./bootstrap/lib/add-asana.sh personal|work         # adds Asana PAT + registers MCP
./bootstrap/lib/add-fathom.sh                      # adds Fathom API key + registers MCP
```

Each script is idempotent — safe to re-run.

## 12. People data model

- **MOC:** `+ Spaces/People.md` — curated grouping by relationship context.
- **Atomic notes:** `+ Atlas/People/<Full Name>.md` — one per person, created from `+ Extras/Templates/Person.md`. The Obsidian graph view is the authoritative relationship map.
- **Interactions:** `+ Atlas/Interactions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` — one atomic note per meeting, call, significant thread, or touchpoint, from `+ Extras/Templates/Interaction.md`. Linked back to people + projects via `[[wikilinks]]` in frontmatter arrays.

### Cadence semantics

Each person note has a `cadence:` field governing how often you should touch base:
- `weekly` — overdue at 8 days since `last_contact`
- `monthly` — overdue at 32 days
- `quarterly` — overdue at 95 days
- `asneeded` — never overdue

Overdue relationships surface in `/what-am-i-missing` and `/people-audit`.

### Candidate staging

New person notes discovered from automated sweeps (`/sync-people`, `/process-inbox` scheduled mode, `/capture-meeting` for unmatched participants) stage at `+ Inbox/people-candidates/<Full Name>.md` — **never directly in `+ Atlas/People/`**. Stubs carry `tags: [person, needs-review, stub]` and an `## Evidence` section listing source touchpoints. Promotion to `+ Atlas/People/` is a manual step: review, fill `relationship`, trim evidence, move file, drop `needs-review`/`stub` tags, and add to `+ Spaces/People.md`.

### Alias resolution

When matching a name or address to an existing person note:

1. **Exact email match** against `emails:` array → definite match.
2. **Exact Slack handle match** against `slack:` array → definite match.
3. **Exact full name match** against `title:` or `aliases:` → definite match.
4. **First-name-only match** → candidate only. Stage for review, never auto-link.
5. **Slack display name** → check against `aliases:` array; treat as candidate if not listed.
6. **Never auto-merge on partial name match alone.** If two person notes look like the same human but identifiers don't overlap, flag for manual review.

### Interaction linking contract

When an interaction note is created (via `/capture-meeting`, `/log-interaction`, or auto-logged by `/sync-people` and `/process-inbox`; note that `/log-note` does **not** trigger this contract):
- The interaction's `people:` frontmatter array lists `[[wikilinks]]` to each participant's person note.
- Each linked person note gets its `last_contact:` updated to the interaction date, and a new bullet under its `## Threads` section pointing back to the interaction note.
- Commitments extracted from the interaction land under `## Open commitments` (theirs / mine) in each linked person note.

**Auto-logged interactions.** `/sync-people` and `/process-inbox` automatically create lightweight interaction notes for direct email threads and Slack DMs/mentions involving known people (those with notes in `+ Atlas/People/`). These auto-logged notes have an auto-extracted summary and leave Decisions/Commitments/Follow-ups sections empty. Mailing lists, Google Groups, CC-only threads, bot addresses, and observer-only threads are excluded. Deduplication is by `source:` frontmatter — one interaction note per thread, and richer notes from `/capture-meeting` or `/log-interaction` always take precedence.

## 13. Chief of Staff skills and commands

Skills live in `.gemini/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (vault-local, portable with the repo). Gemini CLI auto-discovers skills and activates them when a task matches. Invoke them by name — e.g. type `/daily-brief` or ask "run the daily-brief skill and follow its procedure step by step".

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/daily-brief` | Daily briefing — calendar + priority mail + Slack + Asana overdue + stale relationships → refreshes the `## Morning brief` section of today's daily note. Re-runnable. |
| `/daily-review` | End-of-day (or any-time) reconciliation — check off what got done, carry forward / drop the rest, push Asana updates → refreshes the `## Evening review` section of today's daily note. Re-runnable. |
| `/process-inbox` | §4 triage across `+ Inbox/` + Gmail + Slack; auto-pushes `#asana/*` notes in scheduled mode. |
| `/meeting-prep` | Briefing for a meeting/1:1 — person note + recent interactions + open commitments + related projects + thread excerpts. |
| `/capture-meeting` | Turn raw notes into an interaction note; update linked people; propose `#asana/*` tasks. |
| `/capture-youtube` | Create a literature note from a YouTube video — fetch metadata, summarize, link to vault. |
| `/log-person` | Create an atomic person note at `+ Atlas/People/`, optionally seed context from cross-account Gmail/Slack search. |
| `/log-note` | Quick-capture a thought, observation, or log entry as an atomic note — no people or interaction required. |
| `/log-interaction` | Lightweight manual touchpoint log (no transcript needed). |
| `/log-idea` | Create an idea note at `+ Atlas/Ideas/`. |
| `/log-decision` | Record a decision with context, reasoning, and alternatives at `+ Atlas/Decisions/`. |
| `/log-goal` | Create a goal note with definition of done and linked projects at `+ Atlas/Goals/`. |
| `/log-place` | Create a place note at `+ Atlas/Places/`. Auto-seeds `address:` + cross-links to people/orgs from recent calendar activity unless run in `quick` mode. |
| `/log-organization` | Create an organization note with key people and places at `+ Atlas/Organizations/`. |
| `/log-quote` | Save a quote with attribution and source link at `+ Atlas/Quotes/`. |
| `/draft-follow-up` | Draft a reply/nudge for the right account. Saves as draft, never sends. Also invoked in batch by `/daily-brief` and `/process-inbox` for actionable "Needs a reply" items. |
| `/learn-writing-style` | Scan your sent email + Slack messages to derive a personalized writing-style profile (email vs Slack, by audience size). Updates `GEMINI.md §6` in place. Run after initial bootstrap. |
| `/what-am-i-missing` | Surface overdue tasks, stale commitments, cadence misses, unanswered mail. |
| `/people-audit` | Cadence health report + regenerate `+ Spaces/People.md` grouping. |
| `/sync-people` | Discovery pass across Gmail/Calendar/Slack — auto-updates `last_contact` on known people, stages unknowns in `+ Inbox/people-candidates/`, proposes alias merges. |
| `/sync-organizations` | Discovery pass across Gmail/Calendar/Slack/Fathom — finds organizations not yet captured in `+ Atlas/Organizations/`, stages candidates in `+ Inbox/org-candidates/`. Mirrors `/sync-people` for the org facet. |
| `/sync-places` | Discovery pass across Google Calendar — finds physical places not yet captured in `+ Atlas/Places/`, stages candidates in `+ Inbox/place-candidates/`. Facet-aware: surfaces when an existing Org should also get a Place note. |
| `/weekly-review` | Monday synthesis → `+ Atlas/Weekly Reviews/<ISO-week>.md`. |
| `/asana` | Quick view of tasks due in the next 7 days across configured workspaces, with interactive check-off. |
| `/pull-openbrain-template` | Pull latest changes from the upstream starter, diff against this vault's infrastructure, and interactively apply each change. |
| `/push-openbrain-template` | Genericize vault improvements and open a PR against the upstream starter — strips personal data, diffs, and creates the GitHub PR after review. |

Skills are markdown procedures only — they describe which MCP tools to call and which files to read/write. They do not execute code; Gemini reads the SKILL.md and performs the steps.

## 14. Tool usage notes

- **MCP tool naming:** Gemini CLI namespaces MCP tools as `mcp_<serverAlias>_<toolName>`. Server aliases use **dashes** (not underscores). Examples:
  - `mcp_google-davidianstyle-gmail-com_calendar_list_events` — Google Calendar for davidianstyle@gmail.com
  - `mcp_google-david-doromind-com_gmail_search_emails` — Gmail for david@doromind.com
  - `mcp_slack-doromind-slack-com_slack_conversations_history` — Slack for doromind.slack.com
  - `mcp_asana-personal_asana_get_my_tasks` — Asana personal workspace
  - `mcp_asana-work_asana_search_tasks` — Asana work workspace
  - `mcp_fathom_fathom_list_meetings` — Fathom meeting recorder
- **When a skill says "for each `google_*` MCP"**, iterate over all MCP servers whose alias starts with `google-`. Use `/mcp` to discover the full list of available servers and tools.
- **Slack write operations:** The local `slack-*` MCPs support both message sending (`slack_conversations_add_message`) and draft creation (`slack_drafts_create` / `slack_drafts_edit` / `slack_drafts_delete`) natively. Use these for all Slack writes.
  - **DM channel resolution.** `slack_drafts_create` needs a real channel id (`C...` for channels, `D...` for IMs). For an existing IM, look it up via `slack_channels_list types=im` matched against the user id from `slack_users_search`. Opening a brand-new DM via `slack_conversations_open` currently fails with `missing_scope` on the OpenBrain Slack OAuth grant; if no existing IM channel is found, surface the limitation rather than substituting another tool.
- **Before recommending any Asana task, Slack message, or Google Doc edit**, verify the target still exists (the state may have changed since the last session).

## 15. Deployment

- When deploying scripts or config files, always verify the target runtime path (e.g., `~/.config/openbrain/`) matches where you expect to run them from, not just the repo directory. The repo contains templates and tracked copies (`.openbrain/`); the live runtime copies live under `~/.config/openbrain/` (mode 755 for scripts, mode 600 for secrets).

## 16. Session loop (output declaration and closeout)

Every free-form interactive session follows an open → work → close loop. The loop forces explicit agreement on what the session is producing before tool calls fire, and gives the closeout a concrete target to verify against.

**Scope.** Applies to interactive sessions where the user describes work in their own words. Does NOT apply to: explicit skill invocations (`/daily-brief`, `/process-inbox`, etc. — each skill's SKILL.md is its own scope contract), scheduled/nightly runs, and truly conversational exchanges (quick lookups, "what's on my calendar"). If you find yourself wanting to skip the declaration frequently in genuinely substantive sessions, surface that as conversation.

### Opening a session

1. **Read what's relevant.** Project MOCs in `+ Spaces/`, person notes per §12's read triggers, the relevant SKILL.md for build work. Don't read what's not relevant.
2. **Run a viability check** when the work depends on MCP tools or system behavior not yet verified this session (e.g., a Google account's OAuth state, a Slack DM channel id). Make a small probe call; name any gaps before going further.
3. **Declare the intended Output**, then build. Get explicit approval before larger or destructive changes.

### Output declaration

Format: `Output: <category> — <specific mechanism>`. One line per primary output; stack lines for multi-output sessions.

Four outcome categories; the mechanism field carries any sub-distinction:

1. **Decision made** — lock a call, with an execution plan when non-trivial. Absorbs "plan established."
2. **Communication drafted** — outbound email or Slack message saved as a draft per §6/§14 (never sent; the user sends). Mechanism names the account/workspace, e.g. `Gmail draft to Jane via jane-acme-com`.
3. **Artifact produced** — standalone deliverable: code, script, skill, Google Doc/Sheet/Slides, file output destined for use outside the vault.
4. **Vault maintenance** — internal upkeep: vault writes (MOC, person, interaction, atomic notes), Asana writes per §5, audits/syncs/analyses of internal state.

**Primary vs. byproduct.** Declared Outputs name the session's primary intent. Maintenance that fires automatically under existing conventions is byproduct and is never declared — it surfaces in the closeout footer instead. The test: if it would happen anyway because conventions require it, it's byproduct; if the user explicitly asked for it, it's a declared Output. Byproducts in this vault include: the §12 interaction-linking contract (`last_contact` + Threads updates), `asana_gid` write-backs (§5), people-candidate staging, and — when the opt-in git-sync hooks are enabled (§10) — the stop hook's Home.md regen + auto-commit.

**Timing.** Declare after the orientation read so the declaration is informed. If the intended output is genuinely ambiguous, ask ("what exactly are we trying to do right now?") rather than guess. If the session shifts mid-stream, add a one-line `Output revised:` callout; don't restate for minor refinements.

**Scope drift.** When something important but outside the declared Outputs surfaces (overdue task, related issue, pattern worth flagging), raise it as a `Scope flag: [thing noticed]. Tack on as new Output, or set aside?` line. Don't act on it inline; don't bury it in prose. High bar for flagging.

### Closing a session

When the session wraps (the user signals done, or ~2 exchanges pass after the last substantive deliverable with no new work), scan what was touched and verify updates landed. Apply anything missed per the autonomous-edit scope below. Then append a two-line status footer:

```
Status — primary outputs: closing clean. Byproducts: closing clean.
Status — primary outputs: in flight (pending: X). Byproducts: in flight (pending: Y).
```

- **Primary outputs**: closing clean iff every declared Output shipped.
- **Byproducts**: closing clean iff every expected automatic update (§12 linking contract, §5 sync write-backs, etc.) fired.

Each layer's "closing clean" requires an actual verification scan against what was discussed vs. what was applied. If unsure, default to "in flight" and name what is uncertain. A false "closing clean" is worse than ambiguity, because the user will trust it. Don't append the footer on every message or early in a session. If nothing durable came out (quick lookup), say so and close cleanly without ceremony.

### Autonomous edit scope

Consolidates the act-vs-propose rules scattered through §4/§5/§9/§12. When in doubt between the two lists, lean autonomous-and-notify (cheap to revert via git) over ask-first (costs the user's bandwidth) — unless §9 says never.

**Autonomous (act, notify in footer):**
- Interaction notes in `+ Atlas/Interactions/` — create and edit per the §12 linking contract.
- Person note `last_contact` + `## Threads` + `## Open commitments` updates per §12.
- `asana_gid`/`asana_workspace` frontmatter write-backs after Asana sync (§5).
- Asana create/update for `#asana/*`-tagged notes during scheduled triage (§5 — explicit opt-in).
- Daily note section refreshes (`## Morning brief`, `## Evening review`) per their skills.
- Candidate staging in `+ Inbox/people-candidates/`, `org-candidates/`, `place-candidates/`.
- Correction propagation to source notes per §17.

**Propose first (wait for explicit go-ahead):**
- GEMINI.md and SKILL.md edits — behavioral code, touches every session.
- Template changes in `+ Extras/Templates/` — require a migration plan per §8.
- Moving/renaming notes in interactive sessions (§4), multi-note refactors, archive actions (§9).
- Promoting candidates into `+ Atlas/People/` (manual step per §12).
- Asana writes for untagged notes or bulk operations >5 tasks (§5).
- Anything outward-facing beyond saved drafts (sending is never autonomous).

The §9 never-list overrides both lists.

## 17. Correction propagation

When the user corrects a fact or interpretation Gemini stated (distinct from disagreeing with a new proposal or draft — that's just working together), trace the error back to its source and fix it there, not just absorb the correction in chat. Otherwise the same wrong belief re-fires next time the source is read.

1. **Trace the source.** Vault note (person, MOC, interaction, atomic), GEMINI.md, a memory file, inference from chat context, or fabrication. If untraceable, say so.
2. **Diagnose.** Source says X and X is wrong → fix X. Source says X and Gemini extrapolated to Y → tighten the wording or add a "not Y" disambiguation. Fabricated → nothing to fix; don't repeat.
3. **Branch on certainty.** Obvious → apply directly (autonomous per §16). Ambiguous (multiple places it could land, or the correction contradicts other entries) → ask one clarifying question, then apply.
4. **Always surface the trace in the response**, even on obvious fixes: "Traced to <note>; updated <section> to reflect <change>." Autonomous propagation without visibility is how silent corruption happens.
5. **Default assumption:** any correction implies a stored-data fix until proven otherwise. Never shrug off a correction as "noted."

When making substantive factual claims about people, projects, or stored context, cite the source note inline when natural so the trace is already on the table if the user pushes back.
